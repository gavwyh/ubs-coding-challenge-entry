UBS Coding Challenge Submission in Python

## Solution

- **Approach**: Utilises basic OOP principles to encapsulate schools and students. Used maps, sets and lists to keep track of objects and for proper mapping into JSON as required.
- **Algorithm**: Used sorting instead of heap due to O(n^2) time bottleneck from looping through schools then students and O(1) space of sorting vs O(students) in heapifying.
